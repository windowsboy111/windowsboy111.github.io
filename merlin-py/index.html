        <p>
            Merlin is a python discord bot written for the KCCS Official discord
            server originally back in Feburary 2020, right after the virus outbreak.
            <br>
            It was intended to satisfy the needs of members in the server, yeah it's
            super customizable, obviously we can do whatever we want, I own the bot
            anyway. But now it's a public bot, it's now for everyone. MIT license,
            open source apparently.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can invite Merlin to your discord server with <a
                href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=690839099648638977&permissions=8&scope=bot">this
                link</a>.<br>
            <b class="warn">Warning: Experimental feature!</b> You can try out <a
                href="https://pypi.org/project/merlin-bot">the pypi version of Merlin</a> :) I haven't try it out, so
            it's potentially dangerous. Be aware that it may coss loss, I mean it's MIT license anyway :P<br>
            Also the invite link is also the link for <a href="https://github.com/windowsboy111/merlin-js">merlin-js</a>
            so you can issue node.js sides commands. The bot in the invite link will only receive updates from the
            master branch, and I'm not going to test my bot with that bot either, so it's safe and stable to use, it
            shouldn't have down-time. Tell me if it does and I will try my best to make it up again. It's probably the
            fault of <a href="https://repl.it/@windowsboy111/merlin-py/">the hosting provider</a> if it's really down.

    <div class="tooltip">Oh, and btw, the fandom page is outdated. And it sucks. I'm not stupid :L
        <p class="tooltiptext">well at least now merlin-js and merlin-py is different repo</p>
