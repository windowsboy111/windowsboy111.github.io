            This is a frozen project. Development has been stopped because
            of inactivity. However I'll still explain it. In ytg we're
            planning to make a webserver as a platform to exchange / donate
            used or unused hardware to users. We've finished planning, we've
            finished designing, but we haven't started programming the
            system yet, since we are all busy on other projects.
